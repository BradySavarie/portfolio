Alright so what needs done for configuration:

    - react router
    - materialUI
    - material icons
    - styled components
    - engine for styled components
    - react testing library
    - jest dom
    - user events
    - vitest
    - prettier (?)
    - any types dependencies
    - framer motion

The above list should be all of the dependencies that I need configured for this project. I'll check them off 1 by 1 tomorrow using the previous project as a reference. This project will be deployed on netlify by the way, no dependencies necessary there but may as well keep it in mind. Doing this will just allow me to get a bit more practice with that platform before I start into nextjs (which uses vercel).
