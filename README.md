<em>This website was developed by yours truly to display my work and help connect with employers, clients, and other developers. It is fully-responsive and features a dark mode option that can be toggled from within the navbar. I used Sagar Shah's portfolio site as a design reference - credits to him for providing an excellent, free Figma file to use as a foundation to build off of. </em>

This application is a part of The Odin Projects Advanced HTML & CSS curriculum and was developed with the purpose of practicing my front-end development skills. The main challenges I faced were learning how to use use Figma to help design and develop a beautiful UI, how to create a dark mode theme that can be toggled using Material-UI's theming system, and how to apply some slick animations via the Framer Motion library.
